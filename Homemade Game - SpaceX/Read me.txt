This is a game I made in 2015 with a friend. The game loads very slow, but still works. If it crashes, just launch it again.

Use the .exe in the Install folder to play it yourself.
-> Drive:\Homemade Game - SpaceX\SpaceX\Install\spacex.exe

The game has no sounds and no ending, but is still a fun project I am proud of.
Enjoy!

What the project does
---------------------
Build linear models whose the response variable is price. Load the data set using the load command, and
then for the command lm, you can specify data = diamonds. Please make sure each predictor has the
correct type such as being categorical or not.
(1) Build a simple linear regression model with carat as the predictor, provide a summary of the
fitted model (i.e., the estimated model), and show diagnostic plots for the model.
(2) Build a multiple linear regression model with carat, cut, x, y, z and depth as the predictors,
provide a summary of the fitted model, provide the variance inflation factor for each predictor,
and show diagnostic plots for the model.
(3) Build a multiple linear regression model with carat, cut, depth, clarity, the interaction
between cut and clarity, the interaction bewteen depth and clarity as the predictors,
provide a summary of the fitted model, provide the variance inflation factor for each predictor,
and show diagnostic plots for the model.

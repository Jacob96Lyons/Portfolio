What the project does
---------------------
Use the data set Auto from the R library ISLR. Build linear models to predict
the response mpg by choosing the best from 7 predictors cylinders, displacement, horsepower,
weight, acceleration, year and origin. Whenever random splitting of or random sampling from
the data set is needed, please set.seed(1).
(1) Apply best subset selection. Identify the best model that is determined by Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) and display its estimated coefficients.
(2) Apply forward stepwise selection. Identify the best model that is determined by adjusted
R-square and display its estimated coefficients.
(3) Apply backward stepwise selection. Identify the best model that is determined by Mallowâ€™s
Cp and display its estimated coefficients.
(4) Apply best subset selection. Identity the best model that is determined by 10-fold crossvalidation
and display its estimated coefficients

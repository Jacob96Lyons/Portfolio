**Patch Notes: Shotgun Showdown**
Small update to the guns today. The short story is that the shotguns will be buffed, making them a much more effective buy. 
The other noticeable update is the lowered prices to the Scout and Burst, conforming to a ‘pistol-save-round’ meta makes both 
weapons purchasable after a single save. This makes killing tanks/ubers easier with more accessible prices to more powerful weapons. 
Although the AK also has become cheaper, it will not be purchasable next round and has received a nerf as well. Lastly, the heavy 
sniper is still a killing machine, so a small nerf to reload speed makes accuracy and range a must with this weapon. Other small
fixes to UI were made.

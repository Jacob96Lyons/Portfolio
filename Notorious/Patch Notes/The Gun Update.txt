Patch Notes: The Gun Update
Finally (after probably too long) all of the in-game items have had a visual overhaul giving them
new models and textures. Not only do the guns have new models, but the upgrades, health boost, and 
knives all do as well. This update also has the added bonus of potentially making way for a future 
update concerning more gun textures being added (hint hint). These notes are to give a general idea 
of changes, but I recommend hopping on to see for yourselves ðŸ™‚.

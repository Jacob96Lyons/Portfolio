_**Patch Notes: The 200% Balance**_

Guns have found a balance at default damage, making for a fun game. What isn’t fun, is the unbalanced damage and health boosts.
To fix this, the guns are receiving buffs and nerfs based on STK (shots to kill) and the CTOS (cost to one shot). This allows 
the unbuffed gameplay to remain nearly the same, based on keeping the same STK, and rebalances the guns based on how much you 
have to spend to make any given weapon “one shot”. This rebalance also tries to make “second round” purchase weapons viable 
late game as well, making comebacks against stronger opponents more likely with skilled gameplay and good choices.

In this repo are two files. One is a shortcut that opens the original Google Sheets link that was used to
create, update, and finalize all tracked stats throughout the pre-season. The other is the same
information but exported to Excel (for convenience). The Excel file may be inaccurate as it is not
curated the same as the original Google Sheet was.
